# Presentation Outline

## 1. Intended User Description (30s)

*   **Who is the intended user (based on application features)?**
    *   The application is built for users needing to analyze patient data trends. Features support identifying high-risk groups (based on readmissions, conditions), analyzing demographics, understanding length of stay factors, and exploring specific patient records. This suggests users like healthcare analysts, researchers, or administrators.
*   **Technical Challenges Addressed in Code:**
    *   The codebase includes logic to parse potentially varied CSV formats (`parseCSVData`).
    *   State management (`useState`, `useEffect` in React components) is used to handle data loading, filtering, and UI updates.
    *   Error handling is implemented for data loading (`loadPatientData`), CSV parsing (`parseCSVData`), and API calls (`generateSummary` in `model/page.tsx`).
*   **Solutions Implemented in Code:**
    *   A detailed `parseCSVData` function handles type conversions, missing values, and potential formatting issues.
    *   Client-side state management coordinates UI elements with data changes.
    *   Error states are displayed to the user (e.g., using `AlertCircle` component).
    *   Data caching (`cachedData` variable, `localStorage` usage) is used to optimize performance.

## 2. User Decision-Making Needs (1 min)

*   **What decisions does the application support (based on features)?**
    *   Identifying correlations between conditions and readmissions (`getReadmissionByCondition`).
    *   Analyzing patient cohort demographics via age, gender, race, ethnicity distributions (`getDemographicDistribution`, `getAgeDistribution`).
    *   Investigating patterns in length of stay (`getLengthOfStayDistribution`).
    *   Tracking condition prevalence across age groups (`getConditionDistribution`, `getConditionsByAge`).
    *   Generating high-level insights from data via AI summarization (`/api/summarize` integration in `model/page.tsx`).
    *   Exploring individual patient details through filtering, searching, and pagination (`reports/page.tsx`).
*   **How needs were addressed in the application:**
    *   Specific data analysis functions were created in `lib/data-parser.ts`.
    *   UI components in `reports/page.tsx` and `model/page.tsx` allow users to interact with these analyses (e.g., filtering, viewing summaries).
*   **Technical Challenges Addressed in Code:**
    *   Implementing multiple data aggregation and filtering functions (`get...` functions in `data-parser.ts`).
    *   Handling asynchronous data loading and API calls (`useEffect`, `async/await`).
    *   Managing UI state for filters, search terms, and pagination.
*   **Solutions Implemented in Code:**
    *   Modular functions in `data-parser.ts` perform specific analyses.
    *   React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) manage component state and trigger data re-fetching/filtering.
    *   API calls include error handling and loading state indicators.
*   **Relevant Coursework:**
    *   Mobile and Web Applications:

## 3. Data Validation and Preparation (1 min)

*   **Process Implemented in Code:**
    *   Data loading from user-uploaded CSV (`model/page.tsx`) or a default file (`/data/patient-data.csv`), with `localStorage` caching (`loadPatientData` in `data-parser.ts`).
    *   CSV Parsing (`parseCSVData`): Splits text into lines, handles quoted fields, skips headers/empty lines.
    *   Type Validation/Conversion: Converts strings to numbers (`parseInt`/`parseFloat`, checks `isNaN`), and to booleans (`parseBoolean`).
    *   Handling Missing/Invalid Data: Uses fallback values (e.g., 0 for numbers) during parsing.
    *   Performance Optimization: In-memory caching (`cachedData`) supplements `localStorage`.
    *   Data Transformation: Calculates derived metrics and distributions (`get...` functions) for reporting.
*   **Technical Challenges Addressed in Code:**
    *   Robustness against different CSV structures/values is addressed via specific parsing logic in `parseCSVData`.
    *   Client-side processing handles potentially large file parsing within the browser.
    *   State management ensures data consistency across components.
*   **Solutions Implemented in Code:**
    *   The `parseCSVData` function includes checks for line length and data types.
    *   Client-side parsing avoids server load.
    *   `useState` manages data state.
    *   Caching (`cachedData`, `localStorage`) improves responsiveness.
*   **Relevant Coursework:**
    *   Information Retrieval:

## 4. User Interface Design (1 min)

*   **Design Implementation Highlights:**
    *   UI built using `shadcn/ui` components (Cards, Tables, Buttons, Selects, Input) for consistency.
    *   Application structure separates data ingestion/summary (`/model`) from detailed reporting (`/reports`).
    *   Visual feedback provided via loading spinners (`LoadingSpinner`), success icons (`CheckCircle`), and error messages (`AlertCircle`).
    *   Data interaction features: `CSVUploader`, preview table, download button (`handleDownload`).
    *   Interactive reporting features: Paginated table, `SearchBar`, `Select` components for filtering, clear filter button.
    *   AI Summary display: Uses a `Card` component with distinct loading/error/success states.
*   **Technical Challenges Addressed in Code:**
    *   Presentation of tabular data is handled using `shadcn/ui` `Table` component.
    *   Filtering controls are implemented using controlled `Input` and `Select` components managed by `useState`.
    *   Asynchronous operations (data loading, AI summary) are managed using `async/await` with UI state updates for feedback.
*   **Solutions Implemented in Code:**
    *   Leveraged `shadcn/ui` library for pre-built, styled components.
    *   Used React state (`useState`) and effects (`useEffect`) to link UI controls to data filtering and display.
    *   Implemented clear loading and error states in the JSX for asynchronous operations.
*   **Relevant Coursework:**
    *   Advanced Software Development & Software Development.
